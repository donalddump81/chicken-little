# First raspberry pi desktop kit

## Summary

I've been wanting to build my first raspberry pi desktop kit for a couple of years now so that way I can host my bots on a different platform that doesn't involve windows. I'm excited to build this because it can run my bots and keep my processes separate from my computer by being on a different system so i no lomger have a slow computer.

## Plan

What steps are you going to take to build it? What tools are you going to use? What will you do first, second, third, etc.?

## Budget

What materials will you need for your project? Where will you get them? How much does it cost? Please include all materials, including components you already own. Make sure to factor in shipping costs and sales tax.
